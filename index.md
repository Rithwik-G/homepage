# Welcome to Rithwik Gupta's Webiste.

Here you will explore programming in a way you never have before.

But, first...

A little bit about the man in question.

Rithwik is an passionate programmer and a problem-solver. He enjoys programming and math due to how they are elegant and force the user to think outside of the box. He has done many competitions and hobby projects in the fields of programming and math, but he also has explored and done competitions in robotics and science. He is always looking for ways to make the world a better place and for ways to expand his knowledge.

# Major Accomplisments

Computer Science: Rithwik has done the USACO contest and is currently in the Silver division. He was 100 points away from Gold in the last contest and hopes to reach Gold in January.

Math: Rithwik placed 5th nationally in the beestar math competition. He took the Fall 2021 AMC 10 A and B and is anxiously waiting for the results. Last year, he took the 2021 AMC 10 A and B and was 2 questions away from qualifying for AIME.

Robotics: Rithwik is the captain of a FIRST Tech Challenge Team. He has led this team to qualifying for the Northern California Regional Championships in the team's first year. He is hoping to become top 10 in Northern Californai this year.

Science/Engineering Fair: Rithwik participated in the Alameda County Science and Engineering Fair in 2021. He created an app to help teachers track student's attendance and attention during online learning while also preventing unauthorized access to zoom classrooms. He won 2nd place in the Computer Science Division and has filed a provisional patent for it. He is also planning on taking part in the Science Fair this year.
