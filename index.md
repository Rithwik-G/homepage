# Welcome to Rithwik Gupta's Webiste.

Here you will explore programming in a way you never have before.

But, first...

A little bit about the man in question.

Rithwik is an passionate programmer and a problem-solver. He enjoys programming and math due to how they are elegant and force the user to think outside of the box. He has done many competitions and hobby projects in the fields of programming and math, but he also has explored and done competitions in robotics and science. He is always looking for ways to make the world a better place and for ways to expand his knowledge.

# Major Accomplisments

Computer Science: Rithwik has done the USACO contest and is currently in the Silver division. He is hoping to reach gold this December.
